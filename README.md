# URL Finder

This repository contains a simple Python script that helps you find the real URL of shortened links. It is particularly useful when you encounter shortened URLs and want to know the actual destination before clicking on them. This script utilizes the `requests` library to make HTTP requests and follows redirects to determine the real URL.

4. **Enter the shortened URL when prompted.**

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (install via `pip install requests`)
- `colorama` library (install via `pip install colorama`)

## Example

Suppose you have the following shortened URLs:

- https://shorturl.at/fgLQV
- https://rb.gy/ju2b1
- https://n9.cl/1ipjk

Running the script with any of these URLs will display the corresponding real URL.
